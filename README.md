# Source-code-Analysis
The project extracts all code from a given GitHub link, converts it into vector embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model, and stores them in ChromaDB. Users can then query the stored embeddings, and the system retrieves relevant code snippets and answers questions using an LLM with a retrieval-based approach.
